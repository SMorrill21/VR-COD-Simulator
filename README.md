# VR-COD-Simulator
I wanted to try using all of my skills that I learned from Create with VR on Unity Learn and put them to the test. I also want to try and replicate the COD 4 tutorial as best as I could since I want to create something like a firing range in VR. I will also be importing some models that I make in Blender to make the experience feel more like my own.
